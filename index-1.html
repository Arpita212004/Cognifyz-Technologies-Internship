      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local.[7] Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.[8]

         Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.
         
         Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality,[9] reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates,[10] enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations, academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets. </p>

      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">The school education system in India is vast and complex. It is overseen by three national bodies: The All India Council for Technical Education, the University Grants Commission, and the National Council of Educational Research and Training. In addition to these, each state has its Department or Ministry of Education, which regulates school education within its jurisdiction.

         In India, the literacy rate for people aged seven and above is 74.04%. The male literacy rate is 82.14% while the female literacy rate is 65.46%. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for higher education in India is 26.30%. The GER is the percentage of people aged 18-23 who are enrolled in higher education institutions. In India, there are more than 700 universities and 37000 colleges.
         
         The education system of India as a whole is not up to the mark. There are many problems in the education system. The quality of education is not good. There is a lot of corruption in the education system. The government is not doing enough to improve the education system.
         
         There are many private schools in India which are providing good quality education. But the fees of these schools are very high. So, only rich people can afford to send their children to these schools. Many public schools in India are not provided with good quality education. The government is not doing anything to improve the condition of these schools.
         
         The dropout rate is very high in India. Many students dropout of school before completing their education. </p>

      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">India has made great strides in improving access to quality education, increasing elementary school enrollment and reducing the number of out-of-school children.

         These achievements have been bolstered by key laws, policies and programmes such as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act (2009), the National Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Policy (2013). However, challenges do remain.
         
         An estimated 6.1 million children out of school in 2014 reduced from 13.46 million in 2006. Out of 100 students, 29 per cent of girls and boys drop out of school before completing the full cycle of elementary education, and often they are the most marginalised children. (Source: SRI-IMRB Surveys, 2009 and 2014)
         
         Around 50 per cent of adolescents do not complete secondary education, while approximately 20 million children not attending pre-school. (Source Rapid Survey of Children 2013-2014 MWCD)
         
         Half of primary school-going children,which constitutes nearly 50 million children â€“ not achieving grade appropriate learning levels. (Source: National Achievement Survey, NCERT 2017)
         
         Furthermore, children school readiness at age 5 has been far below expected levels. Over the first half of the Country Programme, there have been various changes in the operating environment that have impacted upon how the UNICEF India Education Programme will operate moving forward.</p>
